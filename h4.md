# x) Why use a feed reader (RSS/Atom) instead of just visiting sites?
- A feed reader collects updates from many websites into one convenient place.

# y)

- A 17-year old scanned a bank's systems using a port-scanning tool.
- He didn't ge into the system, but the Supreme Court still saw it as attempted data breach.
- In Finland, scanning someone else's systems without permission can be criminal.

# a, b, c, d and e)
- I installed NetNewsWire feed reader and added Krebs, Schneier on Security, The Hacker News and darkreading feeds. The first two were in the assignment and the latter two were my own additions.
- I wrote down a note about The Hacker News during past lectures and I found it interesting. Darkreading feed I found after some google searches.
- What I learned after starting to use feed reader:
  - I don't have to keep checking websites manually.
  - The feed shows a clean list and text without ads.
  - Feed readers are more private as there are no cookies that I need to accept.

# f) Port scanning exercise

A Linux virtual machine running inside UTM on a Mac was used to perform this exercise. All commands were executed inside the virtual machine's terminal, and all port scans targeted only ```localhost``` inside the virtual machine. Port scans were also done offline as a safety measurement to avoid scanning external systems.

## Step 1

I started the exercise by installing ```nmap``` while still online, which is a network and port scanning tool that is used to discover which ports and services are open on a host.

## Step 2

Next step while still online was to install ```apache2```, which is a web server daemon that I was to use later to demonstrate how starting a new service changes the open ports on my system.

## Step 3

After I had installed both ```nmap```and ```apache2``` I swtitched off my Internet connection. I tested this by sending an echo request to an IP address to see if the target was reachable. I used the command ```ping 8.8.8.8```

<img width="819" height="509" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d766ea3d-910f-4fb6-a2d5-c3a90cca2478" />

As we can see from the screenshots, the target was not reachable, so the Internet connection was off.

## Step 4

After confirming that the virtual machine was offline, I ran a port scan against ```localhost``` to make sure that the scan only targeted the virtual machine's own network, not any other device.

The command line used was ```sudo nmap -A -v localhost```.

From the results we can see that ports 22/tcp (SSH) and 631/tcp (IPP) are open.

## Step 5

Next I wanted to start a daemon (Apache web server) while offline to see if there are any differences.

The command line used to start ```apache2```service was ```sudo systemctl start apache2```. Then I did the port scan again using the command line ```sudo nmap -A -v localhost```.

<img width="824" height="520" alt="localhost" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2b4e7de-affb-4317-b3d1-c44577ff61bb" />

We can see from the results that there is a new port open after starting ```apache2``` service: 80/tcp (HTTP). What this mean in practice is that when the new http service was started the port 80/tcp opened, which was not open before starting ```apache2``` becoming a new entry point that clients or attackers could use to interact with the system.

## Conclusion

In this exercise I demonstrated how criminals can discover what services an organization's systems are running. In my virtual machine, I used ```nmap```only on ```localhost```, but an attacker could use the same tool against servers on the internet or inside a company network.

A port scan can reveal which ports are open and which services are listening behind them. Each open port could be a potential entry point. If an attacker finds a web service running on some specific port, they can check whether that software version has vulnerabilities. If the software is outdated they might be able to exploit it.

I also showed in the exercise that by starting a new service the potential attack surface also increased.

## Explanation about commands that were used in this exercise:
- ```sudo``` runs the following command with administrator priviledges. Installing software requires elevated permissions.
- ```apt-get update```tells the system what versions of packages are available.
- ```apt-get -y install nmap```the ```apt-get```command talks with online software repositories, ```-y```means that I have selected 'yes' and ```install nmmap``` tells the system to install ```nmap```. Combined together it means that I tell the system yes to download and install ```nmap``` from online software repositories.
- ```ping```sends an echo request packets to an IP address and waits for replies.
- ```8.8.8.8```is a public DNS server that is used in this case to check if the virtual machine can reach the wider Internet.
- ```localhost```term refers to the local machine itself.
- ```nmap```network mapper tool that is used to scan hosts and ports.
- ```-A``` refers to aggressive scan mode.
- ```-v```verbose output that shows information about what ```nmap```is doing.
- ```systemctl``` is a control tool for ```systemd```service manager.
- ```start apache2```tells ```systemd```to start the ```apache2```service.
