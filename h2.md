* The Schneier on Security article: AI Summarization Optimization states that the most important meeting attendee in today's world is AI notetaker.
* The consequence of having an AI notetaker can lead to people talking in a different way that would be more likely to be emphasized in the AI summary.
* This way of talking is similar to search engine optimization, where certain keywords are used to be more likely to be included in the search results.
* Words such as "key takeaway", "key outcome", "what matters here..." can be interpreted by the AI notetaker as of high value information.
* Talking in such words could manipulate the summary of the meeting
* This might result in some new policies in companies where these techniques are being moderated in meetings to avoid AI summarization optimization.
* AI summarization is shaping how humans behave in situations where AI is used.
