## Assesment process (Traficom, 10)

The assessment process can be divided into 5 steps as presented in the Traficom's framework:
1. **Initiation:** The process starts when a management team decides to starts and sets goals for the assessment. A sponsor and facilitator is appointed for the process.
2. **Preparations:** The sponsor and facilitator decide together on which operating areas should be assessed and critical depedencies like systems, processes, and data assets. Based on those decisions, they identify key stakeholders from the organisation and agree on the methodology and schedule.
3.  **Assessment:** The assessment is conducted by the facilitator with the stakeholders using the Cybermeter self-assessment tool.
4.  **Development activities:** The results of the assessment are analysed, target level of the organisation's operations are set, and developement activities are identified and prioritised in development plans.
5.  **Execution of activities and updates to the assessment:** The development activities are executed within the organisation and the original assessment is updated, and if needed it will be re-asesssed.
