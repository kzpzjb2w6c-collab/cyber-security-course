# x) Summary of Traficom's Cybermeter: National framework for the assessment of cybersecurity capabilities
## Assesment process 

The assessment process can be divided into 5 steps as presented in the Traficom's framework (Traficom, 10):
1. **Initiation:** The process starts when a management team decides to starts and sets goals for the assessment. A sponsor and facilitator is appointed for the process.
2. **Preparations:** The sponsor and facilitator decide together on which operating areas should be assessed and critical depedencies like systems, processes, and data assets. Based on those decisions, they identify key stakeholders from the organisation and agree on the methodology and schedule.
3.  **Assessment:** The assessment is conducted by the facilitator with the stakeholders using the Cybermeter self-assessment tool.
4.  **Development activities:** The results of the assessment are analysed, target level of the organisation's operations are set, and developement activities are identified and prioritised in development plans.
5.  **Execution of activities and updates to the assessment:** The development activities are executed within the organisation and the original assessment is updated, and if needed it will be re-asesssed.

## Cybermeter maturity model
### Cybermeter maturity model is presented as a four-level scale in the Trafricom's framework (Traficom, 11) to help organisations to understand their own cybersecurity maturity level:
- Level 0 means that activities in the organisation do not meet basic requirements.
- Level 1 means that basic requirements are met in the activities, but work is inconsistent and ad-hoc in it's nature.
- Level 2 means that activities are more advanced, processes are documented, there are sufficient resources and skills, and clear roles and responsibilities in the organisation.
- Level 3 means that activities are advanced and continiously improved, guided by policies with preformance goals and monitoring.
  
### Key concepts presented in the Traficom's framework (Traficom, 11-12):
- Capability: ability to operate correctly in a specific area using processess, people and their skills, and information and systems.
- Maturity model: examines organisation's activities in levels, and each level has pre-defined requirements or objectives.
- Operating area: services or functions that are critical for the organisation or society. Operating area also includes supporting processes, systems and data resources.

### Cybermeter framework examines 11 domains (Traficom, 12)
1. Protection of critical services (CRITICAL)
2. Risk management (RISK)
3. Supply chain and external depdencies management (DEPEDENCIES)
4. Asset, change and configuration management (ASSET)
5. Identity and access management (ACCESS)
6. Threat and vulnerability management (THREAT)
7. Situational awareness (SITUATION)
8. Event and incident response (RESPONSE)
9. Workforce management (WORKFORCE)
10. Cybersecurity architecture (ARCHITECTURE)
11. Cybersecurit program amangement (PROGRAM)

### Maturity indicator level calculation model is calculated in three stages (Traficom, 13)
1. Each practice is rated with four options: not implemented, partly implemented, mostly implemented, or completely implemented.
2. For each objective, a level is chosen from three options: 100% practices at level 1, more than 50% and all level 1 practices, or more than 50% of practices and all level 1 and 2 practices are implemented.
3. Each domain's maturity level is the lowest level of its objectives, emphasising the the significance of the weaket area.
