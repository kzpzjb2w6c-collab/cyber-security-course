# x) Summary of Traficom's Cybermeter: National framework for the assessment of cybersecurity capabilities
## Assesment process 

The assessment process can be divided into 5 steps as presented in the Traficom's framework (Traficom, 10):
1. **Initiation:** The process starts when a management team decides to starts and sets goals for the assessment. A sponsor and facilitator is appointed for the process.
2. **Preparations:** The sponsor and facilitator decide together on which operating areas should be assessed and critical depedencies like systems, processes, and data assets. Based on those decisions, they identify key stakeholders from the organisation and agree on the methodology and schedule.
3.  **Assessment:** The assessment is conducted by the facilitator with the stakeholders using the Cybermeter self-assessment tool.
4.  **Development activities:** The results of the assessment are analysed, target level of the organisation's operations are set, and developement activities are identified and prioritised in development plans.
5.  **Execution of activities and updates to the assessment:** The development activities are executed within the organisation and the original assessment is updated, and if needed it will be re-asesssed.

## Cybermeter maturity model
### Cybermeter maturity model is presented as a four-level scale in the Trafricom's framework (Traficom, 11) to help organisations to understand their own cybersecurity maturity level:
- Level 0 means that activities in the organisation do not meet basic requirements.
- Level 1 means that basic requirements are met in the activities, but work is inconsistent and ad-hoc in it's nature.
- Level 2 means that activities are more advanced, processes are documented, there are sufficient resources and skills, and clear roles and responsibilities in the organisation.
- Level 3 means that activities are advanced and continiously improved, guided by policies with preformance goals and monitoring.
  
### Key concepts presented in the Traficom's framework (Traficom, 11-12):
- Capability: ability to operate correctly in a specific area using processess, people and their skills, and information and systems.
- Maturity model: examines organisation's activities in levels, and each level has pre-defined requirements or objectives.
- Operating area: services or functions that are critical for the organisation or society. Operating area also includes supporting processes, systems and data resources.

### Cybermeter framework examines 11 domains (Traficom, 12)
1. Protection of critical services (CRITICAL)
2. Risk management (RISK)
3. Supply chain and external depdencies management (DEPEDENCIES)
4. Asset, change and configuration management (ASSET)
5. Identity and access management (ACCESS)
6. Threat and vulnerability management (THREAT)
7. Situational awareness (SITUATION)
8. Event and incident response (RESPONSE)
9. Workforce management (WORKFORCE)
10. Cybersecurity architecture (ARCHITECTURE)
11. Cybersecurit program amangement (PROGRAM)

### Maturity indicator level calculation model is calculated in three stages (Traficom, 13)
1. Each practice is rated with four options: not implemented, partly implemented, mostly implemented, or completely implemented.
2. For each objective, a level is chosen from three options: 100% practices at level 1, more than 50% and all level 1 practices, or more than 50% of practices and all level 1 and 2 practices are implemented.
3. Each domain's maturity level is the lowest level of its objectives, emphasising the the significance of the weaket area.

## Cybermeter maturity report
- The cybermeter maturity report is aimed for cybersecurity and risk management professionals and other technically responsible people.
- The report shows results and development areas in the different domains that is easy to get a good overview of the maturity levels.

## Cybermeter spreadheet
- Offline version that is downloadable that enables offline usage
- The benefit is that organisation's assessment data is not shown to other parties, which could result in sensitive information about the organisation's weaknessess to leak.

# a) Make-believe story about using the Cybermeter tool:
Characters in the story:
- Jacob (J): Chief Information Security Officer
- Wilma (W): Human Resources Director
- Michael (M): Head of Customer Services

### 2a - Cybersecurity awareness activities occurs, at least in ad hoc manner
- J: We have a monthly awareness session for all employees regarding cybersecurity and we have a cybersecurity awareness month with extra sessions for our employees.
- W: We can see statistics about the participation rate for our employees in the sessions, in addition we have emails that are sent to employees where they can test their skills with a quiz that are also educational in their nature.
- M: If we were to choose the level, I think we are more than the basic leve, so let's choose 'Fully implemented'.

All parties agree on the chosen level.

### 2d - Cybersecurity awareness activities are conducted periodically
- J: We have phishing simulations that happen on regular basis and our experts book calendar slots from employees to watch awareness sessions each month excluding holidays.
- W: I have received complaints that we have too many quizes and sessions that is away from doing the business with our customers.
- M: My employees complain that the phishing simulations are too easy.
- J: I can see from my data that people still fall into the simulations, so I think they are still necessary.
- W: Should we agree that we set this as 'Fully implemented'?
- W & M: Yes, I think we can agree on that.

### 2g - The effectiveness of cybersecurity awareness activities is evaluated and improved
- J: We follow closely to the trends of cyberattacks and modify our simulations and awareness trainings based on that.
- W: We could improve on the area by doing a more comprehensive yearly online training module to get more data on the areas that are weak in our organisation.
- M: I agree, I'm not sure how mature my area is on the cybersecurity awareness. We do the quizes and react to the simulations but we could benefit from more data. Should we choose partially implemented?
- J & W: yes, I think that would be the appropriate level.
