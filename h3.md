# Command Line Basics Revisited
* Terminal is a good way to access information from the computer.

# Cracking Passwords with Hascat
* The commands did not work for me. I received a message that
  * "E: could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied).
  * E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?

I first installed UTM on my Mac and created a new virtual machine using the `debian-13.1.0-arm64-netinst.iso` image as my Mac runs on different CPU architecture that Windows users use. After the normal Debian installation, I logged in as my user `nexus` inside the VM.

At first, `sudo` did not work for my user `nexus` (as I was not in the sudoers group).  
To fix this, I logged in as root and added myself to the `sudo` group.

```bash
su -
usermod -aG sudo nexus
exit
```
After this change, I can run admin commands as nexus using sudo and my own password. In a real multi-user system this is a strong permission, so you’d only give it to trusted users.

I continued to install hashcat:

- `hashid`helps identify hash types.
- `hashcat`is a tool used for cracking passwords.

I then proceeded to create a folder for the hash exercise and moved into it and then downloaded `rockyou.txt` file.:

I then extracted the wordlist from the `rockyou.txt`file

The given hash to be used in the exercise was 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96 and used MD5 hash (`-m 0`) to be used in the process.

I then used hashcat to crack the password using MD5 hash.

We can see from the screenshot that the hash belongs to the password `summer`.
- `Status: Cracked` and `Recovered: 1/1` means that hashcat succesfully found the password for the hash that I gave to it.

## Conclusions

- The process went extremely fast and showed that MD5 is probably not very suitable for storing passwords.
