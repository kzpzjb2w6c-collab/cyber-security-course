# What are the key areas being researched?

* The key areas being researched in the article are cloud security issues and challenges.
* World has become increasingly more digital and the lack of common standards in the security architecture of the cloud has become an ongoing problem. With more users, the impact of cyber attacks is more severe as the amount of devices that can be attacked is larger.
* Cloud computing has become a popular way to offer services through the internet as it allows users to access the services without having to install the software on their computers. However, in cloud computing, the data is stored in data centres by cloud services providers (CSP), which means that data privacy and information security are top issues for cloud customers.

# What's widely agreed upon?

* Common threats and effects on cloud computing are:
  * Various service delivery and receipt models: outsourcing services can blur the line between who does what, if roles aren't clear.
  * Cloud computing abuse and malicious use: throwaway accounts can be used for launching DDoS attacks.
  * API and interface security issues: incorrect transfer of the content, improper authentication and authorization can let attackers read or change data.
  * Malicious insiders: employees might misuse their access to damage or leak the data.
  * Shared technology issues: by exploiting the hypervisor, interfere with one user service and other user services.
  * Data leakage and loss: personal information about the user might be changed, removed, corrupted, or wiped.
  * Service or account theft: the security of a services is at risk when user account information is stolen since it grants access to a key area of the cloud.
  * Risk assesment: internal security procedures, security standards, configuration breaches, patch, audit, and log.
  * Theft of identity: to access that user's resources and obtain credits or other benefits under the username, an attacker can obtain the identity of a legitimate user.
* Common attacks and effects on cloud computing are:
  * Denial of service attack: if service availability is compromised, a fake service could be formed.
  * Attack using service injection: service integrity is compromised, and users are given malicious services in place of legitimate services.
  * A virtualization attack: acquire the login details and delegate authority to another user.
  * A user-to-root attack: obstruct the privacy of sensitive client information and services.
  * Port scanning: unusual service behaviour reduces service availability.
  * Attack by a man-in-the-middle: breach data security and privacy.
  * Attack on spoofing metadata: abnormal service behaviour compromises service privacy.
  * Attack by phishing: a user's sensitive personal data is shared.
  * Attack through the backdoor: give rights for obtaining legitimate user resources, impact service, avaiability and data privacy.


# What are the open questions?

* How should service providers integrate cyber risk management practices in a framework that connects business, policy, and technological perspectives?
* How should service providers shift their focus from compliance to action?
* How should service providers identify areas that require further development as new threats emerge?
* How to manage trust when outsourcing severs the connection between the data owner and their data?
