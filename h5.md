- Cryptography is used, when a sender wants to send a message to a receiver and doesn't want anyone to eavesdrop the message.
- In cryptography a message that is written in plain text is encrypted so that it becomes cipher text that is difficult to read. On the receiver side the cipher text is decrypted back to plain text so that it's readable again.
- For computers both plain text and cipher text are both binary data that it can read. In cryptography a key and an algorithm is used to turn plain text into cipher text and then decrypted back again into plain text so that only someone with the right key can read the message.

- A protocol is a sequence of steps that two or more parties need to follow in order to complete a task. Everyone involved in the process must know and follow the steps.
- Protocols can be found everywhere in life outside computer networks, like voting in an election or ordering food over telephone. Everyone knows how to accomplish those tasks and they have been established over time.
- Cryptographic protocols are needed because human interaction takes often place over computer networks as not all people are honest over the computer networks. This has created a need for protocols so that tasks are accomplished excactly how they are intended. They have created to create trust that is in face-to-face encounters in computer network environment.
- Cryptohraphic protocols are created to prevent eavesdropping and cheating. They formalize interaction over computer network with clear steps so that no one can do or learn more than what is specified in the protocol.
