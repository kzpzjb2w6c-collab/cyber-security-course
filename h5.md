- Cryptography is used, when a sender wants to send a message to a receiver and doesn't want anyone to eavesdrop the message.
- In cryptography a message that is written in plain text is encrypted so that it becomes cipher text that is difficult to read. On the receiver side the cipher text is decrypted back to plain text so that it's readable again.
- For computers both plain text and cipher text are binary data. In cryptography a key and an algorithm is used to turn plain text into cipher text and then decrypted back again into plain text so that only someone with the right key can read the message.
